PRO-FOOTBALL-REFERENCE DATABASE

============================================================================
The data included here were obtained from a number of different sources.
Much of it was hand-entered.  I have made every effort to check the accuracy
of this data, but some errors will inevitably creep in.  In other words, THE
DATA CONTAINED IN THE PRO-FOOTBALL-REFERENCE DATABASE SHOULD IN NO WAY BE
CONSIDERED OFFICIAL.  USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Doug Drinen and
pro-football-reference.com assume no responsibility whatsoever for anything bad
that happens to you as a result of using this data.
=============================================================================

The database consists of 3 files (in addition to this one).  They are all
comma-delimited text files and they can be downloaded separately from 
http://www.pro-football-reference.com/download/ .  Each is
briefly described below.

----------
master.csv
----------
ID, last name, first name, position, birth year, debut year

NOTES:
1.  The player's ID is an 8-character string that identifies him uniquely
throughout all the other data files.
2.  I may have some players' positions wrong.  I think that problem is
limited to a few cases of WR/TE confusion.

Current contents:  all players whose LAST season was 1960 or later, plus a 
few all-time greats from before that.  EXCEPTIONS:  I may be missing a few 
players whose complete careers took place in 1978 and 1979.  Also, a few
players with very minimal playing time may be missing.


-----------
seasons.csv
-----------
ID, last name, first name, year, team, position, G, GS, COMP, ATT, PassYD,
PassTD, INT, rush, rushYD, rushTD, rec, recYD, recTD

NOTES:  
1.  The last name, first name, and position may not always match the given
players' entry in the master table.  I'm working on fixing this.  
2.  GS is not available for all entries.  If I didn't have it, I put down a
zero.  So not all zeroes in that field are actually zeroes.
3.  Players who played for multiple teams in the same season will have a
separate line for each team, and no total line for that season.  
4.  Team abbreviations are not always what you'd expect.  For example, Eddie
George's team is "oti", which represents "Oilers/Titans" (the best I could
do with 3 letters).  
Current Contents:  the complete careers of all the players listed in the
master file.


---------
games.csv
---------
ID, year, team, week, opp, comp, att, passYD, PassTD, INT, rush, rushYD,
rec, recYD, Total TDs rushing and receiving

NOTES:
1.  Rushes are not included for WRs (but rushing yards are).  Likewise,
receptions are not included for RBs (but receiving yards are).
2.  Opponent is not included for 1995. 
3.  Unlike the "seasons" file, you'll need to correlate this to the
"master" file in order to make much sense out of it.
Current Contents:  all games played from 1995 - 2006.
